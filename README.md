# White-Throated Sparrows Feathers

Traditionally juvenile birds grow all their feathers in the nest over a short time period while adult birds incrementally molt their feathers over a longer time period. Therefore, there may be different energetic demands which mediate differences in composition of feathers between adult and juvenile birds. White-throated Sparrows are a polymorphic species, so there may also be differences between sex and morph. Here we perform a t-test, two-way ANOVA, and ANCOVA to investigate differences between adult and juvenile White-throated Sparrows.
